{"name":"Glassmaker","tagline":"Glassmaker helps you to build Java based Glassware for the Google Glass using Mirror API","body":"Glassmaker helps you to build Java based Glassware for the Google Glass using Mirror API\r\n\r\nGlassmaker has two primary parts:\r\n  - Eclipse tools to simplify the process of authoring and creating Java based glassware using the Mirror API. \r\n  - And components for springframework to simplify the development of Java modules. These components include SSO using Google OAuth2 services, spring templates for the Mirror API, and Timeline Item templates (Card) using Freemarker.\r\n\r\nThe Glassmaker IDE tooling can be installed into an existing Eclipse IDE from\r\n\r\n  - http://glassmaker.org/updates/0.0.1\r\n  - IMPORTANT: Glassmaker requires Google Plugins for Eclipse (GPE). Please install them prior to installing glassmaker from https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/getting_started\r\n  - A short video demo for installation:\r\n   [![video demo for installation](http://img.youtube.com/vi/J_WXaQAcowg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_WXaQAcowg)\r\n\r\nFor FAQ, and more information visit the site:\r\n\r\n  - http://eteration.github.io/glassmaker/faq.html\r\n\r\n\r\nGlassmaker IDE tooling will generate a template Web project complete with Oauth2\r\nintegration, samples pages and controllers to start building new glassware, as well\r\nas allwoing you to create, edit and preview Timeline items called \"Cards\". IDE plug-ins,\r\nand Card Editors will provide syntax highlighting, content assistance, error\r\ntracing/debugging and similar capabilities, as appropriate. The glassware can be tested\r\nand debugged directly from the IDE using a local application server or the Google App \r\nEngine. Finally, the glassware can be  published to the cloud right from the IDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project has three near-term objectives: \r\n\r\n  - (1) Flatten the learning curve associated with using the Mirror API\r\n  - (2) Support Java best practices for working with the Mirror API and\r\n  - (3) Encourage sharing tools with the community\r\n\r\nA longer-term objective will be to provide a home for a wider range of tools\r\nto simplfify developing glassware using Java.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
